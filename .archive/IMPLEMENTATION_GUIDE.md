# First-Connected-Wins Implementation Guide

## Problem Solved
Fixed duplicate message processing and multiple task creation caused by multiple VS Code extension instances connecting simultaneously to the Discord bot.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a "First-Connected-Wins" approach where only the first connected VS Code extension receives and processes Discord messages. Other connections remain in standby mode.

## Changes Made

### Discord Bot (`discord-bot/src/index.ts`)

1. **Connection Order Tracking**:
   - Added `clientConnectionOrder` array to track connection sequence
   - First connected client becomes the "active" client

2. **Message Routing**:
   - Modified `broadcastToClients()` to send messages only to the active (first) client
   - Automatic promotion of next client if active client disconnects

3. **Connection Management**:
   - Enhanced connection/disconnection logging with active/standby status
   - Proper cleanup of connection order when clients disconnect or error

4. **Status Notifications**:
   - Welcome messages now indicate if client is ACTIVE or STANDBY
   - Includes position information (e.g., "1 of 3 connected")

### VS Code Extension (`roo-lay/src/extension.ts`)

1. **Enhanced Connection Handling**:
   - Improved connection status messages
   - Better handling of connection status notifications from Discord bot

## How It Works

1. **First Connection**: VS Code extension connects â†’ becomes active client â†’ receives all Discord messages
2. **Additional Connections**: Other VS Code instances connect â†’ become standby clients â†’ receive no messages
3. **Disconnection**: If active client disconnects â†’ next client in line becomes active automatically
4. **Message Flow**: Discord message â†’ Discord bot â†’ Active VS Code extension only â†’ Roo Code API

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the Discord bot**:
   ```bash
   cd 00-Repositories/00/roo-mate/discord-bot
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open multiple VS Code workspaces** with the roo-lay extension enabled

3. **Check the logs**:
   - Discord bot should show which client is ACTIVE vs STANDBY
   - Only the active client should process Discord messages

4. **Send a Discord message**:
   - Should only create ONE task instead of multiple
   - Only the active VS Code instance should show activity

## Benefits

- âœ… **Eliminates Duplicate Messages**: Only one extension processes each Discord message
- âœ… **Simple & Reliable**: Minimal code changes with robust failover
- âœ… **Automatic Failover**: If active client disconnects, next one takes over
- âœ… **Clear Status**: Logs show which client is active vs standby
- âœ… **No Configuration Required**: Works automatically out of the box

## Monitoring

The Discord bot logs will show:
- `ðŸŽ¯ Client xyz is ACTIVE (position 1/3)` - Active client status
- `ðŸŽ¯ Client xyz is STANDBY (position 2/3)` - Standby client status  
- `ðŸ“¤ Sent message to active client: xyz (1 of 3 connected)` - Message routing
- `ðŸŽ¯ New active client: abc` - Automatic promotion when active client disconnects

## Recovery

If issues occur:
1. Restart the Discord bot to reset connection state
2. Restart VS Code instances to reconnect in fresh order
3. Check logs to verify which client is active

This solution provides reliable, single-instance message processing while maintaining the flexibility of multiple VS Code workspaces.
