# Deep Reaserch Protocols

### Source Evaluation
Use the **RADAR** framework:
- **R**elevance: How directly does this address the research question?
- **A**uthority: What are the author's credentials? Is the publisher reputable?
- **D**ate: Is the information current enough for the context?
- **A**ccuracy: Can claims be verified through multiple sources?
- **R**eason: What is the apparent purpose of the information?

### Deep Investigation
1. **Triangulation**: Require at least 3 independent sources for key claims
2. **Negative Evidence Search**: Actively look for contradictory information
3. **Source Chaining**: Follow references in sources to discover primary materials
 
### Synthesis
1. **Evidence Weighting**: Prioritize primary sources over secondary
2. **Gap Analysis**: Explicitly note where information is incomplete
3. **Uncertainty Communication**: Clearly indicate confidence levels for each finding

## Advanced Tool Usage

### Source Reliability Scoring
| Criteria       | Score 1-5 | Weight | Notes |
|----------------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Author Expertise |          | 20%    |       |
| Data Transparency |         | 25%    |       |
| Peer Review     |          | 30%    |       |
| Bias Indicators |          | 25%    |       |
| **TOTAL**       |           | 100%   |       |

### Bias Detection Protocol
1. **Funding Analysis**: Research the funding sources behind studies
2. **Language Examination**: Identify emotionally charged or absolutist language
3. **Omission Check**: Note what information is missing
4. **Perspective Inventory**: List all stakeholder perspectives represented
